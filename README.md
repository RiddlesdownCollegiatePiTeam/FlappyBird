## Playing the game

You control the little bird. You can make it climb by pressing the up arrow on the MakeyMakey, or using your voice through a USB microphone. Don't crash into any pipes! For every pipe you pass without colliding, you get one point.


## Requirements

You will require the following python modules to run it on your system - it does not have a specific system dependency but you may find that the input device index changes on different systems:

-SoundAnalyse
-PyAudio
-PyGame
