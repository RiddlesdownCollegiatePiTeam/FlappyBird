## CloudFly (using Pygame)

A clone of the popular app *Flappy Bird*, using Pygame.

## Playing the game

You control the little bird. You can make it climb by pressing the up arrow on the MakeyMakey, or using your voice through a USB microphone. Don't crash into any pipes! For every pipe you pass without colliding, you get one point.


## Requirements

You will require the following python modules to run it on your system - it does not have a specific system dependency (i.e. you can use Linux, Windows or Mac (although it hasn't been tested on the latter two) but you may find that the input device index changes on different systems:

-SoundAnalyse  
-PyAudio  
-PyGame
