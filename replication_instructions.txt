Compiling / Installing Instructions:
1. Install the necessary libraries on your Pi (sudo portaudio19-dev) 
2. Install the necessary Python modules (pip install pyaudio, pip install pygame, pip install)
3. Download/clone the GitHub repo
4. To run the program you may have to make a few edits, but the only changes you will likely have to make is changing the "PYAUDIO_DEVICE_INDEX" constant (which is currently set to 2, because on our test devices this was the device index, it may differ for your devices)
5. You can also edit other features such as
   - The font for the app (Python code - lines 331-333)
 Â  - The background image (Edit the "background.png" file in the "images" folder, along with the "WIN_WIDTH", and "WIN_HEIGHT" constants, which will correspond with your image)
   - The "Bird" (Edit the "bird_wing_up.png" and "bird_wing_down.png" files in the "images" folder - take care to scale this down so that the bird fits through the pipes!)
   - The "Pipes" (Edit the "pipe.png", "pipe_end.png" and "pipe_body.png" files in the "images" folder - make the dimensions of these similar to the current dimensions, to avoid having to edit the code.
6. Follow the instructions to run the program
